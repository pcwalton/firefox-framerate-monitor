This is a simple framerate monitor for Firefox 4. It was hacked up in an hour
or two. Expect many bugs!

To install, unpack this into the `packages/` directory in the Jetpack SDK. You
can get the Jetpack SDK here [1]. Enter the Jetpack SDK, and use
`source bin/activate`. Then enter `packages/firefox-framerate-monitor`, and use
`cfx run` to start Firefox.
